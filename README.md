This Python script creates a full-screen currency converter application using Tkinter. It features multiple pages, each with distinct functionalities: quick conversions, tracking currency trends, viewing and saving custom exchanges, and fetching the latest currency news. Users can perform live currency conversions, save custom exchanges for easy access, and visualize historical exchange rates through graphs. The app also allows users to fetch the latest forex news via the News API, displaying it in a scrollable text widget. The interface is designed with a focus on user experience, incorporating clear navigation buttons, styled widgets, and options to switch between different currencies. The script utilizes threading to handle currency conversion and news fetching asynchronously, ensuring a responsive user interface.
